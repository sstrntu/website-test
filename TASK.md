# Task Tracking

## Current Session - 2025-09-12

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
- [x] Create 3D stadium website with Three.js 
- [x] Implement Jesse Zhou's cinematic techniques (bloom, reflections, lighting)
- [x] Add dramatic zoom-in intro sequence 
- [x] Configure custom camera positions for zoom sequence
- [x] Fix camera initialization issue preventing proper starting position
- [x] Organize repository structure according to Claude.md specifications
- [x] Implement globe-to-stadium zoom flow (2025-09-13)
  - [x] Create interactive Earth globe with basic continent textures
  - [x] Multi-scale camera system (Globe ‚Üí Stadium ‚Üí Detail)
  - [x] Distance-based element visibility transitions
  - [x] Extended OrbitControls range (1 to 2000 units)
  - [x] Updated intro sequence with globe-stadium-detail flow
  - [x] Performance optimization for different zoom scales

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] Create backend Python application structure
- [ ] Set up frontend TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Create Docker configuration files
- [ ] Move assets to proper directories

### ‚è≥ Planned Tasks
- [ ] Set up FastAPI backend application
- [ ] Create docker-compose.yml for multi-service setup  
- [ ] Convert HTML to proper TypeScript structure
- [ ] Add environment configuration files
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md
- [ ] Set up testing framework (pytest for backend, Jest/Vitest for frontend)
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Add Git configuration (.gitignore for large files)

### üí° Future Enhancement Ideas
- [ ] Interactive stadium hotspots with raycasting
- [ ] Multiple stadium models/themes
- [ ] User preference storage via backend API
- [ ] Real-time stadium data integration
- [ ] Mobile-optimized controls and performance
- [ ] Stadium tour mode with guided camera paths

### üêõ Issues & Notes
- Stadium model (stadium.glb) is 15MB - should be optimized or moved to Git LFS
- Large image files (Group 1 copy 5.jpg/jpeg) need to be added to .gitignore
- Current setup uses simple HTTP server - needs proper development environment

### üìù Development Notes
- **Camera Scales**: Sphere (1500+ units) ‚Üí Stadium (300-1500 units) ‚Üí Detail (1-300 units)
- **Camera positions**: Sphere (0,0,2500) ‚Üí Stadium (0,0,800) ‚Üí Detail (19.43, 9.88, 21.53)
- **Controls**: G/S/D keys for quick scale jumps, scroll wheel for smooth transitions
- Using GSAP for smooth animations and Three.js EffectComposer for post-processing
- Performance scaling implemented for different device capabilities
- Sphere rotation at 0.002 rad/frame for visual appeal
- Element opacity transitions based on zoom distance thresholds
- HTTP server on port 3006 for CORS resolution during development
