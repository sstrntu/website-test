# Task Tracking

## Current Session - 2025-09-12

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
- [x] Create 3D stadium website with Three.js 
- [x] Implement Jesse Zhou's cinematic techniques (bloom, reflections, lighting)
- [x] Add dramatic zoom-in intro sequence 
- [x] Configure custom camera positions for zoom sequence
- [x] Fix camera initialization issue preventing proper starting position
- [x] Organize repository structure according to Claude.md specifications

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] Create backend Python application structure
- [ ] Set up frontend TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Create Docker configuration files
- [ ] Move assets to proper directories

### ‚è≥ Planned Tasks
- [ ] Set up FastAPI backend application
- [ ] Create docker-compose.yml for multi-service setup  
- [ ] Convert HTML to proper TypeScript structure
- [ ] Add environment configuration files
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md
- [ ] Set up testing framework (pytest for backend, Jest/Vitest for frontend)
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Add Git configuration (.gitignore for large files)

### üí° Future Enhancement Ideas
- [ ] Interactive stadium hotspots with raycasting
- [ ] Multiple stadium models/themes
- [ ] User preference storage via backend API
- [ ] Real-time stadium data integration
- [ ] Mobile-optimized controls and performance

### üêõ Issues & Notes
- Stadium model (stadium.glb) is 15MB - should be optimized or moved to Git LFS
- Large image files (Group 1 copy 5.jpg/jpeg) need to be added to .gitignore
- Current setup uses simple HTTP server - needs proper development environment

### üìù Development Notes
- Camera positions: Start (133.79, 47.85, 140.74) ‚Üí Default (19.43, 9.88, 21.53)
- Using GSAP for smooth animations and Three.js EffectComposer for post-processing
- Performance scaling implemented for different device capabilities
- HTTP server on port 3006 for CORS resolution during development
