# 3D Stadium Website

Interactive 3D football stadium visualization built with Three.js, featuring cinematic camera work inspired by Jesse Zhou's techniques.

## ✨ Features

- **Cinematic 3D Experience**: Dramatic zoom-in intro sequence from far to close view
- **Interactive Stadium Model**: High-quality 3D stadium with realistic lighting and textures  
- **Enhanced Visual Effects**: Bloom post-processing, reflective surfaces, atmospheric particles
- **Smooth Camera Controls**: GSAP-powered animations with multiple viewpoints
- **Performance Optimization**: Device-adaptive quality scaling for optimal performance

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Development (Current)
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Start simple HTTP server for development
python3 -m http.server 3006

# Open browser to http://localhost:3006
```

### Docker Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Access frontend at http://localhost:3006
# Access backend API at http://localhost:8000
```

## 🎮 Controls

- **Mouse**: Orbit around stadium
- **Scroll**: Zoom in/out for detailed inspection
- **Auto-Intro**: Automatic cinematic zoom sequence on page load

## 🎨 Technical Highlights

### Jesse Zhou's Cinematic Techniques
- **Baked Lighting Effects**: Realistic stadium floodlight illumination
- **Bloom Post-Processing**: Enhanced HDR lighting with UnrealBloomPass
- **Reflective Surfaces**: Ground plane reflections using Three.js Reflector
- **Smooth Camera Transitions**: GSAP animations for cinematic movement

### Performance Features
- Device capability detection and quality scaling
- Optimized rendering pipeline with EffectComposer
- Efficient particle systems for atmospheric effects
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## 🛠️ Development

### Backend Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run development server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Run tests
pytest

# Code formatting
black . && flake8
```

### Frontend Development  
```bash
# Install dependencies (when converted to TypeScript)
cd frontend && npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Docker Commands
```bash
# Development with hot reload
docker-compose up

# Production build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose logs -f frontend

# Shell access
docker-compose exec backend bash
docker-compose exec frontend sh
```

## 📊 Camera Positions

The application uses specific camera coordinates for optimal viewing:

- **Start Position**: `(133.79, 47.85, 140.74)` - Far aerial view
- **Default View**: `(19.43, 9.88, 21.53)` - Optimal stadium perspective
- **Close Inspection**: Scroll to zoom closer than default for detailed views

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- [ ] TypeScript migration for type safety
- [ ] Interactive stadium hotspots with raycasting
- [ ] Multiple stadium themes and models  
- [ ] User preference storage via backend API
- [ ] Real-time stadium data integration
- [ ] Mobile-optimized touch controls
- [ ] Stadium tour mode with guided camera paths

## 📋 Requirements

- **Node.js** 18+ (for TypeScript development)
- **Python** 3.9+ (for backend)
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (recommended)
- **Modern Browser** with WebGL support

## 🎨 Design Inspiration

This project implements techniques from Jesse Zhou's ramen case study:
- Cinematic lighting and post-processing effects
- Smooth camera transitions and dramatic reveals  
- Performance optimization for wide device compatibility
- Atmospheric visual enhancements
